Three roles they can play:
1. Consigliere - resolves tricky situations
2. SME - subject matter experts
3. Connectors - utilising their network and helping you meet the right people

How to meet them:
1. Get a warm intro
2. Don't do an email spam
3. Why them?

How to retain them:
1. Let them know you value them and their time
2. Ensure your incentives are aligned
3. Give them equity - advisor agreements, typically 0.1-0.3% (if higher then they should be a superstar and it should be clear what they're bringing to the table)
4. Come prepared with questions/problems/priorities - don't "pick their brain" and make them do all the work
5. Follow up like you would any business meeting
  - Thank them for the meeting
  - Send a summary - here's what I'm going to work on
  - Here's what I'd like to talk about in the next meeting
