They typically play three types of roles:
1. Consigliere - resolves tricky situations
2. SME - subject matter experts
3. Connector - utilising their network and helping you meet the right people (able and willing)
  - Fundraising
  - Clients

How to meet them:
1. Get a warm intro (social proof)
2. Don't do an email spam to mutliple people
3. Why them? Sell to them
  - Did you do your homework?
  - What do they have that you want?

How to retain them:
1. Let them know you value them and their time
2. Ensure your incentives are aligned
3. Formalise the relationship / Give them equity - advisor agreements, typically 0.1-0.3% (if higher e.g. 0.5% they should be a superstar and it should be clear what they're bringing to the table)
4. Come prepared with questions/problems/priorities - don't "pick their brain" and make them do all the work
5. Follow up like you would any business meeting
  - Thank them for the meeting
  - Send a summary - here's what I'm going to work on
  - Here's what I'd like to talk about in the next meeting
