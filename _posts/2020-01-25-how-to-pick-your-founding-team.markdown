Why?
- Knowledge gaps - you don't know what you don't know

Who?
- Complimentary (not just skillsets, temperament)
  - They can do things you can't do
  - You don't want a clone of you
  - Different from you in the important ways
- A partner
- Confident they'll get stuff done and figure stuff out
- Why do you want to do this for the next decade?
- Not just the idea / why you want to solve a problem / why
  - Focus on the person, not the idea
  - Don't go in and hard sell your idea (it doesn't feel like a partner, it will probably change)
- Zero evidence that being friends matters, in fact being friends can make you ignore red flags
- Generally no more than 3 co-founders (too many cooks in the kitchen)
  - 3 can be hard (2 against 1)

How?
- Your first sales and marketing task
  - Taking a leap with you
  - You have to make them believe
  - Show them your passion
- Work together on something
- Have a trial period (90 days?)
- Ask questions - [https://fi.co/insight/34-questions-to-ask-a-potential-co-founder](https://fi.co/insight/34-questions-to-ask-a-potential-co-founder)
  - What are your deal-breakers?
- Simulate a fight - are you able to resolve things fast and keep moving?
- Check references

When?
- Don't look for a co-founder when you have nothing, after you've quit your job (you seem desperate)
- Find one before your leap or when things are going well

Equity
- 5-10 year time horizon
- Ideas are worth nothing, execution is everything (unless it's a patent, etc)
- More than 10%, doesn't have to be 50/50 (sometimes better as decisions end with someone)
- Co-founders should vest and should start vesting from when they started
- Who's bringing more to the table? (Not what already has been done)

When does it go bad?
- They're holding you back (time/speed is your greatest asset)
  - You can't resolve and move quickly
  - They're not doing the work
