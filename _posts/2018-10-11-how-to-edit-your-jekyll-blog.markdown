1. Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
2. Download [Atom](https://atom.io/)
3. Clone your blog repository
It should look something like https://github.com/YourUsername/YourUsername.github.io/
Click the green clone or download button. If it's been a while since you cloned it then make sure to click Fetch origin in GitHub Desktop before making any edits
4. Open your blog folder in atom
5. Open the posts folder (it has an underscore before its name)
6. Right click on a post and duplicate it (note the post is a .md file)
7. Rename the file name according to the correct date and name of the post (put dashes where there should be spaces and omit punctuation)
8. Open the file and edit the details in the top of the file (title, date, description, tags)
9. Underneath the content at the top (on a new line after the triple dash) you can start writing. If you've already written your post elsewhere then just paste it in.
10. Format your post
If you want to hyperlink a word or phrase, surround it with square brackets and then immediately follow the square brackets (no spaces) with parenthesis including the URL
If you want to make a word italics add an asterisk either side of it
If you want to make a word bold add two asterisks either side of it
For more formatting tips use this [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
11. Drop a copy of the image you want to use into the img folder (under assets) and make sure the name and file extension of the file matches the image you specify at the top of your md file in your post settings
12. Make sure you have saved your md file (Ctrl + s) and then open Github desktop
13. At the bottom left where it says summary, add a summary of the changes, e.g. New blog post about cute dogs
14. Hit the button that says commit to master
15. Hit the button that says Push origin
