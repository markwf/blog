Team activities are great for:
* Building camaraderie among employees
* Strengthening work and social relationships
* Mixing members of the team that otherwise don't interact much - encourage cross-functional collaboration and understanding
* Challenging people to work together and solve problems together
* Providing enjoyable and memorable experiences that help you acquire and retain good staff
* Improving the work environment

Think about what outcome you're looking for from your activity and what your budget is. Consider which activities match your team's culture and which might alienate some (e.g. drinking-based activities might prevent some of your team from participating).

Here are some ideas for (mainly London-based) team activities:

- VR team building experiences (e.g. [Steamed Egg](https://www.steamedegg.io/). You can create paint works collaboratively, play various games against or with each other, do mindfulness sessions and more)

- Wildlife drawing (they bring live creatures like meercats and foxes to your office and lead a drawing class it's amazing)
- Hampstead heath ghost tour (around Halloween only, brilliant guided tour of haunted pubs around Hampstead, with actors to play the ghosts. Includes a walk across Hampstead Heath in the dark. V spooky)

- Samba band (they come and teach you to play all the drums and by the end you work together to perform a song together)
- Summer sports day & picnic
- Street art tour
- Ping pong and/or pool tournament
