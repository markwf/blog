Financial modelling is the practice of building a representation of of a real-world financial situation. They are used across the financial services industry and as you can imagine, can be incredibly complex when dealing with billion dollar insurance companies for example.

However, our use case is fortunately not as complex. Financial modelling for a startup is useful for a number of reasons, including:
1. Giving you an idea of your **burn-rate** and therefore **runway** so you know how much cash you need in the bank
2. Helping you optimise cashflow to ensure your assets are being utilised to their full advantage
3. Securing capital from investors by providing a clear indication of the financial future of the business

We can break a financial model down into five key components:

1. **Revenue Model**
  - How are you going to get paid?
  - How much are you going to get paid?
  - When are you going to get paid?
  - How are you going to price your product or service?
  - How are customers going to pay for it?
  - How often are customers going to buy it?
2. **Gross Margin Model**
  - Out of the money that you charge the customer (revenue) how much is going towards delivering that product or service to completion and what's left over?
3. **Operating Model**
  - What's the cost to operate the business? Support, marketing, administration, infrastructure, services, software
4. **Working Capital Model**
  - How much revenue do you need to generate from your customers after paying operating costs in order to support the business?
5. **Investment Model**
  - How fast and how large of a return can an investor expect?

The stage your business is at will determine how complex of a financial model you'll need. If you're very early on you might just need the some classic revenue calculations on the back of a napkin. Or you might want to use a spreadsheet tool to quickly estimate your projected costs like below:

If you're a little further along you might want to consider using a tool such as [FUTRLI](https://www.futrli.com/) or constructing your own spreadsheet model of higher complexity.

A simple model can be created using a **balance sheet**, **income statement** and **cash flow statement**, connecting these together using formulae and projecting forward. A good way to construct your model is to create another sheet specifically for your **assumptions**, which feed into the model and create the newly predicted sheet and statements.
