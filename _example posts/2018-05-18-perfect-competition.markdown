## Perfect Competition

A market is perfectly competitive when:
1. There are a large number of buyers and sellers
2. All sellers have a similar product
3. Buyers and sellers are able to freely enter and exit the market
4. Buyers and sellers possess perfect information

Price-taker = price of product is pegged to prevailing market price

In order to maximise profit, she should keep producing kale until the marginal cost of the next bundle is equal to the marginal revenue generated by that bundle

Marginal revenue (MR) = the amount of money received for most recent bundle sold

When marginal revenue = marginal cost => profit

Average Total Cost (ATC) = total costs / cost of good being produced

Average variable cost (AVC) = variable costs / cost of good being produced

Profit Maximising quantity = when market price is equal to marginal cost

## Short Run and Long Run

Decisions in the short run and long run

When market price < shutdown price you can't cover all variable costs (must shutdown)

In the long run fixed costs become variable costs

In the short term fixed costs are sunk (this month's mortgage payment must be paid)
