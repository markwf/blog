## Managerial Accounting

### What is Managerial Accounting?

Financial accounting looks at the company as a whole and primarily focuses on preparing the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement - all of which contain historical information. Used primarily by those external to the company - shareholders and creditors.

Managerial accounting (cost accounting) involves the identification, measurement, analysis, and interpretation of the production, service, and other operating costs of a business. It's for internal use, includes future projections and often reports on individual departments.
