## Cost Volume profit Analysis

Cost Volume profit analysis quantifies relationships between costs, units sold and profit earned

CVP analysis is only valid in a particular relevant range

the amount that the sale price (SP) exceeds the variable costs (VC) is the contribution margin (CM)

CM = SP - VC

Operating leverage is a measure of how much a change in sales revenue affects operating income. Higher variable costs relative to fixed costs reduce how much an increase in sales revenue trickles down to operating profit.

Degree of Operating leverage (DOL) = total contribution margin / total operating profit

(FC + pi) / CM

Margin of safety = range between breaking even and target profit

# Capital Budgeting

CB is the analysis of potential investments e.g. purchase of new manufacturing equipment

The payback period = length of time it takes for purchase to pay for itself

Net present value = is the difference between the present value of all cash inflows and the present value of all cash outflows of an investment. NPV discounts future cash flows to reflect their diminished worth today

Internal rate of return = the discount rate that produces a net present value of 0

When IRR is less than required rate of return, do not accept project
