## Defining Economics

Economics is the study of choices made in the presence of scarcity

What is produced?
How much is produced?
For whom is it produced?

Marginal benefit (MB) of a decision considers the immediate positive impact thereof

Marginal cost (MC) of a decision considers the immediate negative impact thereof

Rational Choice Theory
1. Act on the goal of maximising satisfaction
2. Rationally believe the benefits of the decision outweigh the costs

Invisible hand theory - self-interest is the motivation for buyers and sellers. This benefits society - driving commerce

# Asymmetric information

AI - one party has more information about a transaction than another

adverse selection - negative consequences result from asymmetric information e.g. degradation of the used car market

Shady transactions represent market failure - a market outcome predicated on flawed information or producing undesirable results

market failure - when markets have worked efficiently to achieve outcomes that are nonetheless predicated on flawed info, or that produce unwanted results

Moral hazard - when someone takes more risks, knowing that another party bears the brunt of those risks

Principal-agent problem - agents (employees) can't always be trusted to act in the best interest of their principals (business owners)

Moral hazard can lead to market failure

Screening - requiring more information
Signalling - revealing private information - in order to influence

# Theory of markets

Market forces - economic drivers that make markets happen e.g.
- Buy more of a product when the price is low
- Increased demand causes prices to rise
- Consumers' tastes are subject to change
- Governmental policy has economic impact

Circular flow model

factors of production

Product market - where businesses sell, and households buy
Factor market - where households sell, and businesses buy


Demand curve (DC) is generally seen as a downward sloping line

Marginal benefit - the benefit gained by consuming the next unit of a good

market price - minimum price = producer surplus

consumer surplus = maximum price (willing to pay)- market price

# scarcity

When resources are scarce, choices come with trade-offs

Production possibilities frontier (PPF)

Increasing marketing availability of one product in a PPF curve, moves the whole curve outward

Indifference curve (IC) - consumer is indifferent as same utility is offered

Marginal rate of substitution (MRS) = Amount of item A willingly given up / Amount of item B received in return

Budget constraint (BC) - limit utility

Where IC and BC meet at a tangent = optimal choice

the income effect - price drop of product makes you feel richer

substitution effect - price drop makes it a better deal, you want to buy more and substitute

# Elasticity and its Applications

Price Elasticity of Demand (PED) = % Change in Q / % Change in P

Elastic goods have a PED > 1 (Luxury good)
Inelastic goods have a PED < 1 (Necessity good)
Perfectly inelastic goods have a PED of 0 (the demand curve for these is a vertical line)
Perfectly elastic goods have a PED that tends to infinity e.g. bottled water
Necessity good = likely to buy it regardless of price change or change in income
Luxury good = only buy when the price is right

For comparing two goods:
Cross-price Elasticity of Demand (CPED) = % Change in Q (Good X) / % Change in P (Good Y)
Substitute goods have positive CPED values e.g. hotdogs and hamburgers
Complementary goods have negative CPED values e.g. hamburger patties and hamburger buns

Income Elasticity of Demand (IED) = % Change in Q (Good X) / Change in Income

Normal goods = goods with positive IED values (increased income leads you to buy more)
Inferior goods = negative IED value (increased income leads you to buy less)
Giffen goods = goods where an increase in price causes an increase in demand e.g. rice

Deadweight loss (DWL) = economic surplus due to market intervention (reduction of economic surplus)

Big changes in demand = big change is DWL

economic surplus = consumer surplus + producer surplus

Price floor - legal minimum that sellers can charge
Price ceiling - legal maximum that sellers can charge
Quota - limit on quantity of goods

## International Trade

Absolute advantage = ability of an individual to produce more of a good or service than a competitor
comparative advantage = ability of an individual to produce a good or service at a lower opportunity cost (OC) than competitors
Specialisation is achieved by focusing production on a good or service made with comparative advantage
