## Job Costing

### What is job costing?


| Direct Manufacturing Costs | Description |
| --- |
| Direct Materials | Raw materials physically part of the product
| Direct Labour | Work required to assemble direct materials into products

| Manufacturing overhead | Production costs that are not direct material or labour costs
| --- |
| Indirect Materials | Costs for materials that are not easily traced to individual products e.g. glue, nails
| Indirect Labour | Labour that supports production, but not working on inventory

| Non-manufacturing costs (SG&A) | Description |
| --- |
|Selling costs | Marketing, selling, delivering
| General and Administrative Costs | Executive salaries, depreciation

### Determining Inventory Costs

| Costing | Description |
| --- |
| Job Order Costing | Assigns individual units of inventory. Each piece of inventory may vary in cost. e.g. wedding cakes (bespoke)
| Process Costing | Averages costs of a large number of units over time. Items then have uniform, predictable cost e.g. soda

Inventory account (on balance sheet) has separate journal entries for:
Raw materials
Work-in-process
Finished goods - ready for sale

Only once inventory is sold that accumulated costs of producing the inventory is expensed through COGS

## Job Costing as a Service

| Product Version | Service Version |
| --- | |
| Raw materials inventory | Materials
| Work-in-process inventory | work-in-Process
| Finished goods inventory | completed services
| Cost of goods sold | cost of services
| Manufacturing overhead | overhead

The resource whose use is the primary driver of overhead costs is known as the cost driver

predetermined overhead rate = estimated overhead / estimated total cost driver

to reconcile extra debit to overhead = debit cost of services, credit overhead

of predetermined overhead is too low then either
- total overhead was underestimated
- total labour hours were overestimated

## Activity-based costing

When overhead is assigned using a single predetermined rate based on a single cost driver such as labour hours, this is known as plantwide costing

activity based costing (ABC) assigns overhead to cost objects - such as hockey sticks - using several cost pools based on the activities required to produce them

A cost pool is a collection of overhead Costs

Cost pools are organised by activities such as purchasing materials, running machines, inspecting finished goods, etc

# Variable costing vs. Absorption Costing

Absorption costing - overhead is entirely absorbed by COGS when inventory is sold to customers

variable costing  - only variable overhead costs are ultimately expensed through COGS, whereas fixed overhead costs are expensed periodically

If more inventory is sold than manufactured, absorption costing reduces net income

If less inventory is sold than manufactured, absorption costing increases net income
